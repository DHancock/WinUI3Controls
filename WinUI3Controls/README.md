### WinUI3Controls

A control library for WinUI3

It contains two controls, a WinUI implementation of the **WPF GroupBox** control and a simplistic palette based color picker.

The library supports trimming and requires one dependent package from the Windows App Sdk 1.8.0 metapackage. It requires at least:

- Net 6.0
- Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI version 1.8.250906003
